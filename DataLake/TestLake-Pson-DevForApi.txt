     "Purpose":"Experiment with making an api to take post requests and write json dat ain to a text file", 
     "extraI-info":"When aking a new lake, start with the initial array bracket, and a descriptive object like tgis one. when the api makes a post request, teh jason data will add a comma at the end of this line, then make a new line to write the json object down. With out this object, there will be a random comma that causes an error when teh jason is attempted to be used.Also, becasue the coomma is inserted at the last line before the new data, it ensures that the latest entry does not have a comma at the end making it easier to tranform into a usable json file.  When you want to use this data, Simply add teh ending array bracket at teh bottom of teh list and then this file will be usable."},

        " maybe group each lake with direectly realated and custom make functions that do operations on teh data so when someone downloasds teh lake they aslso get doem pre written code to use to analie it.",
        " also maybe have premade Formatting fulters as a midle ware function to ensure that the data being put into this lake by any given api is following the expected format rules.",
